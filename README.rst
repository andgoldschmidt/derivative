Numerical differentiation of noisy time series data in python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**derivative** is a Python package for differentiating noisy data. The package showcases a variety of improvements that can be made over finite differences when data is not clean.

Want to see an example of how **derivative** can help? This package is part of **PySINDy** (`github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy <https://github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy/>`_), a sparse-regression framework for discovering nonlinear dynamical systems from data.

This package binds common differentiation methods to a single easily implemented differentiation interface to encourage user adaptation.
Numerical differentiation methods for noisy time series data in python includes:

1. Symmetric finite difference schemes using arbitrary window size.

2. Savitzky-Galoy derivatives (aka polynomial-filtered derivatives) of any polynomial order with independent left and right window parameters.

3. Spectral derivatives with optional filter.

4. Spline derivatives of any order.

5. Polynomial-trend-filtered derivatives generalizing methods like total variational derivatives.

6. Kalman derivatives find the maximum likelihood estimator for a derivative described by a Brownian motion.

7. Kernel derivatives smooth a random process defined by its kernel (covariance).

.. code-block:: python

    from derivative import dxdt
    import numpy as np

    t = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,50)
    x = np.sin(t)

    # 1. Finite differences with central differencing using 3 points.
    result1 = dxdt(x, t, kind="finite_difference", k=1)

    # 2. Savitzky-Golay using cubic polynomials to fit in a centered window of length 1
    result2 = dxdt(x, t, kind="savitzky_golay", left=.5, right=.5, order=3)

    # 3. Spectral derivative
    result3 = dxdt(x, t, kind="spectral")

    # 4. Spline derivative with smoothing set to 0.01
    result4 = dxdt(x, t, kind="spline", s=1e-2)

    # 5. Total variational derivative with regularization set to 0.01
    result5 = dxdt(x, t, kind="trend_filtered", order=0, alpha=1e-2)

    # 6. Kalman derivative with smoothing set to 1
    result6 = dxdt(x, t, kind="kalman", alpha=1)
    
    # 7. Kernel derivative with smoothing set to 1
    result7 = dxdt(x, t, kind="kernel", sigma=1, lmbd=.1, kernel="rbf")
